# decomi

This repo is a combination of several experiments that were used to explore unsupervised learning on code-mixed data.
In particular, it consists usage of several methods to make language models and do sentiment analysis. 
`vendors` consist of several subfolders, some which are forks of external projects like MUSE and LASER and others include some important part of the project like language models and twitter scrapping.

[Here](https://github.com/sedflix/decomi/wiki/Papers) you can find a list of useful papers for this area.
